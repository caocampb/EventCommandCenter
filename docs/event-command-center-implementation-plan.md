## Linear-Inspired Design Implementation

To truly embody The Linear Way as defined by Karri Saarinen (Linear's cofounder and design leader), we'll meticulously implement these specific design elements across all features. Following Karri's design philosophy of thoughtful minimalism and craftsmanship, every detail matters:

### Typography & Visual Language
- [ ] **Inter font family** used exclusively (400, 500, 600 weights only)
- [ ] **Monochromatic color scheme** with minimal accent colors
  - Primary UI: Dark (#0F0F0F, #1E1E1E, #2D2D2D)
  - Accents: Linear purple (#5E6AD2, hover: #8D95F2)
  - Functional colors limited to status indicators only
- [ ] **8px spacing grid** applied consistently throughout interface
- [ ] **4px border radius** on all containers and interactive elements
- [ ] **1px borders** (#333333) to define space without drawing attention
- [ ] **JetBrains Mono** for time values only

### Interaction Patterns
- [ ] **Button press animation** completes in precisely 120ms
- [ ] **Hover states** appear after 50ms delay to prevent flicker
- [ ] **Focus transitions** use 150ms ease-in-out curve
- [ ] **Status indicators** use 10% background with 100% text color
- [ ] **Card selection** uses left border accent (#5E6AD2) instead of full background change
- [ ] **Command palette** (âŒ˜K) with instant response and optimistic UI

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] **Timeline operations** complete in under 100ms
- [ ] **Vendor filtering** returns results within 150ms
- [ ] **Budget calculations** update in real-time
- [ ] **Page transitions** complete in under 200ms
- [ ] **API responses** processed and displayed in under 300ms
- [ ] **Form submissions** provide feedback within 100ms (optimistic UI)

### Craftsmanship Details
- [ ] **Cards maintain 16px padding** regardless of content
- [ ] **Table rows use 40px height** for ideal touch targets
- [ ] **Empty states** guide users toward appropriate actions
- [ ] **Error messages** explain both what happened and how to resolve
- [ ] **Loading states** show meaningful progress rather than generic spinners
- [ ] **Focused micro-interactions** on critical user actions

This meticulous attention to these specific details will ensure the application truly feels like a Linear-inspired product, with the same level of polish and thoughtful implementation that makes Linear distinctive.

Remember to update this plan based on what you learn during implementation. This is a living document that should evolve with your project.
