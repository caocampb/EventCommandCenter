   - Provides narrative context for feature decisions

10. **[Implementation Decisions](./decisions.md)**
   - Documents key technical decisions made during development
   - Explains reasoning behind architectural choices
   - Tracks significant technology selections
   - Serves as a record for future reference

## Documentation Principles

We follow these principles in our documentation:

### 1. Clarity Over Completeness
- Prefer clear, concise explanations over exhaustive detail
- Use plain language accessible to all team members
- Include visual aids when they enhance understanding
- Focus documentation on what's needed, not what's possible

### 2. Authoritative Sources
- Each decision has ONE authoritative source document
- When documents conflict, follow the hierarchy above
- Reference the authoritative source rather than duplicating content
- Update at the source, then propagate changes

### 3. Living Documentation
- Documentation evolves alongside the product
- Update documentation with each significant product change
- Treat documentation work as equal in importance to feature work
- Review documentation accuracy during each development cycle

### 4. Progressive Detail
- Start with high-level concepts, then drill down
- Layer information from essential to specialized
- Enable skimming while providing deep detail when needed
- Structure headings and sections to support rapid navigation

## When to Update Each Document

| Design Foundations | Design patterns evolve, Performance standards change, New interaction patterns emerge | Design Lead |
| Architecture & Technical Implementation | Technical stack changes, Database schema updates, Component patterns change | Technical Lead |
| Implementation Plan | Timeline shifts, Task priorities change, New implementation details emerge | Project Manager |
| Backend Implementation | API patterns change, Data models evolve, Security requirements update | Backend Developer |
| UI Mockups | Interface layouts change, New screens are added, Component designs are refined | UI Designer |
| User Journey Map | User flow changes, New pain points identified, Emotional outcomes shift | UX Researcher |
| Implementation Decisions | New technical decisions are made, Architectural approaches change, Technology selections are updated | Technical Lead |

## Documentation Workflow

1. **Change Identification**: Identify needed documentation changes during planning
2. **Update Authoritative Source**: Make changes to the primary document
3. **Consistency Check**: Review related documents for alignment
4. **Propagate Changes**: Update dependent documents as needed
5. **Team Review**: Have relevant stakeholders review changes
6. **Publish**: Commit documentation updates with related code changes

## Template Use

For consistency, we use these patterns across documentation:

### Feature Documentation Template
```
## Feature Name

**Core Purpose**
[One sentence description of what this feature does]

**User Value**
[How this benefits the user]

**Implementation Approach**
[Key technical/design considerations]

**Success Criteria**
[How we know this feature is working correctly]
```

### Decision Documentation Template
```
## Decision: [Title]

**Context**
[Background information and the problem we're solving]

**Options Considered**
[List of alternatives with pros/cons]

**Decision**
[The choice we made]

**Rationale**
[Why we made this choice]

**Consequences**
[What becomes easier or harder because of this]
```

## Documentation Debt

Like technical debt, documentation debt accumulates when our docs don't match reality. We track documentation debt in the same system as technical debt and prioritize it similarly.
