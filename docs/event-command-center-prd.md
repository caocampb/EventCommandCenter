# Event Command Center PRD

## Context

**Customer Messaging**  
Event Command Center is an AI-assisted event planning tool that transforms basic event requirements into structured, manageable workflows. It provides professional event planners with a comprehensive system for timeline management, vendor coordination, and budget tracking in a Linear-inspired, focused interface.

**Problem**  
Event planners struggle with fragmented tools and processes:
- Critical event information is scattered across multiple systems
- Vendor selection requires manual filtering through countless options
- Timeline management lacks proper detail and responsibility tracking
- Budget tracking is disconnected from vendor and timeline management
- Multi-event projects lack proper hierarchical organization

**Solution**  
A focused event management system that:
- Centralizes timeline creation with detailed 15-30 minute blocks
- Provides advanced vendor filtering and organization
- Integrates comprehensive budget tracking
- Supports nested event structures and vendor hierarchies
- Generates essential event documentation

**Options considered and deliberately rejected**
- Generic project management tools (lack specialized event features and force unnecessary complexity)
- Customizable permission systems (customization creates training burden and security risks)
- Feature bloat through excessive integrations (we choose focus over breadth)
- Separate mobile application (a responsive web app serves most needs without additional cognitive load)
- Timeline visualization alternatives (Gantt charts add complexity that doesn't enhance comprehension)
- Freeform task management (we enforce structured timeline blocks to ensure consistent planning)

## Usage Scenarios

**Scenario 1: SXSW Event Coordinator**  
When managing multiple SXSW events with up to 250 attendees, the coordinator needs to track various venues, entertainment options, and catering services while ensuring timeline precision. Using Event Command Center, they create a detailed run-of-show with 30-minute blocks, assign responsibilities to team members and student assistants, and filter vendors by capacity and budget constraints. The system highlights potential scheduling conflicts across multiple events and provides budget tracking that shows actual vs. projected costs. The coordinator generates professional run-of-show documents and contracts for vendors with a single click.

**Scenario 2: Corporate Dinner Organizer**  
For a corporate dinner with variable attendee counts (typically 30-100 people), the organizer needs to manage fewer vendors but requires precise timeline coordination. They use Event Command Center to create a streamlined event plan, select from preferred vendors based on past ratings and appropriate capacity, and track a modest budget with itemized expenses. The responsibility system ensures clear task assignment between the two team members. The system generates a shopping list for supplies and a detailed setup schedule. After the event, they save it as a template for future similar dinners, allowing for easy adjustment of guest counts for each new event.

**Scenario 3: Multi-Day Conference Manager**  
A program operator manages a three-day conference with various sessions, speakers, and vendors. Using Event Command Center, they create nested timelines for each day with priority designations for different sessions. The vendor management system tracks multiple service providers, including those with hierarchical relationships where one vendor manages others. The budget tracking covers the entire conference while breaking down expenses by day and category. The system generates comprehensive documentation including contracts, run-of-shows, and inventory lists.

## The Event Command Center Way

Event Command Center takes a thoughtful position on how events can be efficiently planned:

### Guided Workflows

1. **Timeline-First Planning** (recommended approach)
   - Event planning works best when starting with the timeline structure
   - Timeline blocks use 30-minute defaults with option for 15-minute precision when required
   - Resources, personnel, and budget connect to timeline blocks for clarity
   - The system encourages completing timeline structure before detailed vendor selection

2. **Structured Vendor Selection**
   - Vendors are evaluated using standardized criteria to simplify comparison
   - The system guides users through a streamlined qualification process
   - Basic pricing and capacity information helps make informed decisions
   - Vendor ratings are encouraged to build institutional knowledge

3. **Budget Management**
   - Complete budgets help prevent unexpected overruns
   - Expenses are organized in a consistent structure for easier tracking
   - The system flags potential budget issues before they become problems
   - Significant budget changes are highlighted for review

4. **Participant-Centric Operations**
   - Logistical decisions are informed by participant needs and counts
   - Special requirements can be identified during initial planning
   - Resource allocation suggestions based on participant data
   - The system flags potential resource issues

These workflows are designed to reduce cognitive load for busy event planners. They provide structure without imposing unnecessary rigidity, helping small teams manage complex events efficiently.

### Deliberately Simplified

To keep the system focused and efficient for small teams, we've intentionally simplified:

- **Task Management**: We focus on timeline blocks rather than arbitrary task lists to reduce management overhead
- **Customization**: We provide sensible defaults rather than extensive customization options that create confusion
- **Permissions**: Simple team access rather than complex permission systems that create administrative burden
- **Integrations**: Focused on a few critical connections rather than maintaining dozens of shallow integrations
- **Documentation**: Contextual guidance rather than extensive manuals, designed for learning through use

By focusing on what matters most for program operations, we create an efficient planning experience that lets small teams accomplish more with less effort.

## UI/UX Approach

The Event Command Center implements Linear design principles:

**Visual Language**
- Monochromatic color scheme with minimal accent colors
- Single typeface (Inter) throughout the application
- Limited weights (regular, medium, semibold) applied consistently
